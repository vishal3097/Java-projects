# Contestant scheduling event 
A camp is organized with three exercises swimming, biking & running. A contestant must complete all the exercises. But for swimming there is a condition of one contestant at a time & so when first contestant is there then second contestant will not be able to enter the pool. Once the first contestant completes then the second can enter the pool. There is no such condition for biking & running.
Three approaches are there to calculate the time
• Maximum Swimming time taken by the contestants in decreasing order
• Maximum Completion time taken by the contestants in decreasing
order
• Maximum biking time & running time taken by the contestants in
decreasing order
The maximum biking & running time will give optimal solution.
After generating a pseudo code on the basis of greedy algorithm this scheduling event problem gets solved.
