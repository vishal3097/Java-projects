# Contestant scheduling event (VD.java)
A camp is organized with three exercises swimming, biking & running. A contestant must complete all the exercises. But for swimming there is a condition of one contestant at a time & so when first contestant is there then second contestant will not be able to enter the pool. Once the first contestant completes then the second can enter the pool. There is no such condition for biking & running.
Three approaches are there to calculate the time
• Maximum Swimming time taken by the contestants in decreasing order
• Maximum Completion time taken by the contestants in decreasing
order
• Maximum biking time & running time taken by the contestants in
decreasing order
The maximum biking & running time will give optimal solution.
After generating a pseudo code on the basis of greedy algorithm this scheduling event problem gets solved.

# Hospital Job Scheduling (VD2,VD3 and VD4)
Here in this job scheduling method it gives a stable match of students to hospitals.
Here there are two cases like on the base of propose and reject algorithm this problem gets solved 
First in case 1
--> If a student has been selected to hospital, hospital selects student and if not selected.
In Case 2
--> If students prefer hospital, if hospital has some preference and if stable match occur.
Currently on the basis of this algorithm many of the recent job seeking problems can be solved.
